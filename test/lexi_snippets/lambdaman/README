This directory contains solution to solve one of the ICFP 2024 competition. It uses multishot handler to carry out a search algorithm.
In this particular program, the multishot handler that chooses the next direction to go 
is equivalent to the program that do the choice directly
in the body. So why bother? One advantage of this style of 
programming is that it separate the searching decision procedure(which lives in handler)
from the main body of the program, but similar separation
can be done by using a function to carry out the decision procedure
and invoke it in the body. So this program does not showcasing
the full power of multishot handler. But it is still a good example.

To run:
```
dune exec -- sstal lambdaman.lx -o lambdaman.c
echo "$(cat API.h lambdaman.c)" > lambdaman.c
clang -I ../../stacktrek -g -O3 lambdaman.c -o lambdaman
```
