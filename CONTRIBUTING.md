## Setup(Assuming you have a local devbox and have access to apple.cs.uwaterloo.ca)
### On Local Devbox
1. Install VSCode and extention [Remote - SSH
](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh)
2. Setup VSCode SSH extension to `apple.cs.uwaterloo.ca` following [instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh#_connect-to-a-remote-host)
3. Connect to `apple`
4. Install additional VSCode extensions on `apple`: [direnv](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mkhl.direnv) and [OCaml Platform](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ocamllabs.ocaml-platform)

### On `apple`(Read [FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kmJdBhl-ugQLXV8p6yBBJAXeuFDlzoiIaVsteCdgv4k/edit?usp=sharing) before proceeding)
1. Install `direnv` using `home-manager`.
2. Clone this repository; `cd` into the directory
3. Run `direnv allow`

### Check if everything is setup correctly
1. Run `dune build` to build the project
2. Open a .ml file and hover over a function or a variable, you should see its type

## Debug
The repository is setup with Ocamlearlybird, a debugger for OCaml with nice integration with VSCode. To debug, follow these steps:
1. Open a .ml file
2. Set a breakpoint by clicking on the left margin of the editor
3. Press `F5`(or `Cmd + Shift + D` and click green button) to start debugging
4. You can now step through the code using the debug toolbar

## Test
We have three kinds of tests, each serving a different purpose. For `Compiler Test` and `Integration Test` we uses Cram Test framework; for `Unit Test` we use ppx_inline_test. Read more in [Writing and Running Tests â€” Dune documentation](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tests.html#)
1. `Compiler Test` runs Lexa complier on a set of simple programs, and compare the generated C code with a previous recorded version. This suite of tests are expected to fail if you are making changes to the code generation logic; when it happens, run `dune promote` to update the tests.
2. `Integration Test` runs Lexa compiler followed by Clang, and checks correctness of the produced binary.
3. `Unit Test` checks correctness of individual OCaml functions.
