Benchmark Programs
==================
This folder contains the program files and descriptions from the [effect-handlers-bench community benchmark](https://github.com/effect-handlers/effect-handlers-bench) and an adapted Makefile.

Moreover, it contains two new folders:

- `effekt` -- programs in the Effekt language that are compiled with our system using lift inference
- `sml` -- manually hand-optimized and minimized programs in SML that aid as a baseline
